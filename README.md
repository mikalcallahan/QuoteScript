# QuoteScript
A little swift script I wrote to randomly display a quote

Author: Mikal Callahan

A swift script that:
- reads in a txt file located at a specific file path
- parses the file at newlines for quotes
- stores parsed quotes into array
- randomly chooses array index
- picks quotes to print
